# Module--JSBasics--Weekly-Test-3
Project Overview
Task
To fetch data from an api using .then and async await.
The link for the GET api is https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=10&page=1&sparkline=false
This will return an array of 10 objects, each containing a name,id,image,symbol, current_price,total_volume
Render all of them in the form of a table as given in the UI.
Handle the promise using both methods, .then and using async await.
Create a search button which allows the user to search and filter the data based on the input.
Create a sort button which allows the user to sort the data based on market cap and percentage change.
